<h2>HTML이란?</h2>
<a href ="https://www.naver.com" target="_blank" title="네이버야~" >Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
The HTML line break element can be used to display poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content in which the division of lines is significant.
<p>For example, say you’re writing a blog post about how to address an envelope or package. You want to include an example of how to format the
sender’s and recipient’s addresses. In that case, you could use the line break element to place the sender’s and recipient’s names, street ad
<img src= "What.jpg" width ="100%" > </p><p>
dresses, and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.Below you’ll see the same address rendered in two different ways. The first uses
one paragraph element and multiple line breaks. The second uses multiple paragraph elements and no line breaks. As a result, the margins are off.
